#### 2 No spaces at the end of the text;
#### 3 Make sure to press enter;  |-_-|

## Summary:
#### Drawback
###### user can only try to look at if there's a UFO's "light" in the specific dates, cities, or shapes, expected user allready know it. its not frendly for the user who first time to visit and never know about anything info before. an also if we type as "lamesa" expect "la mesa",the website can not work.
#### Recommendations
###### 1 the filter data might have a visual dataset and spot the date it has the UFO's news happen in order to help user easy to see or just gang on here.
###### 2 reset button is no obviously easy to find. maybe under the fiter set would be a better option.
